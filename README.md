### Overview

`chaos-galago` is a project designed to assist in proving applications running on Cloud Foundry are cloud resilient. It is deployed as a service broker and therefore available on the marketplace as a bindable service.

It works by aggressively stopping application instances based on the configured probability and frequency of the bound service instance.

### Usage

```
cf create-service chaos-galago default {service_instance_name}
cf bind-service {app_name} {service_instance_name}
```

A service instance will be created with the default probability (0.2) and frequency (5) set.
Many applications can be bound to a single service-instance if you desire them to use the same probability and frequency.

All frequencies are set in minutes and can be any value between 1 and 60.
All probabilities are set as a float and must be between 0 and 1.

Both probability and frequency can be reconfigured via the dashboard. Note: This is an unsecured endpoint.

To get the dashboard url:

```
cf service {service_instance_name}
```

Example output:

```
Service instance: {service_instance_name}
Service: chaos-galago
Plan: default
Description: Provides the ability to cause chaos on bound application instances
Documentation url: https://github.com/FidelityInternational/chaos-galago

Last Operation
Status: create succeeded

### Deployment

Clone this project.

```
go get -t -u -f github.com/FidelityInternational/chaos-galago/...
```

A deploy script is included in order to make deploying chaos-galago as simple as possible.

Requirements:
* Go [buildpack](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/go-buildpack/releases) 1.73 or later

What the script does:
* Creates an Org and Space to deploy chaos-galago too
* Sets up required user-provided-services - these are configuration only!
* Deploys the chaos-galago applications
* Creates the service broker
* Enables service access to the server
* Zero downtime upgrades of the broker if it is already deployed

What the script does **NOT** do:
* Create a database - chaos galago requires a SQL database, the deploy script will configure the application to connect to a previously existing database.

**If you want to use a managed service to provide your database** like p-mysql, clear db, elephantsql or else that comes from a `cf create-service` you can!
* Create your service with `cf create-service p-mysql 512mb chaos-galago-db`
  * Ensure that the name of the service is *chaos-galago-db*
* Omit the `DB_` variables mentioned in the table below
* Run `deploy.sh` with the `--managed-db` argument.

| CF_SYSTEM_DOMAIN     | Yes      | The system domain of Cloud Foundry, the deployment script will need to connect to https://api.CF_SYSTEM_DOMAIN and chaos-galago will need to connect to both https://api.CF_SYSTEM_DOMAIN and https://login.CF_SYSTEM_DOMAIN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
